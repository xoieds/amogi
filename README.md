makes a mosaic image of smaller colour shifted images

 - put frames for processing in /frams/ folder
 - finished images will be saved to /donefrmas/
 - change "am2.jpg" to a different image to change the images the final image will be made from
 - at the moment putting too many or too large images in the frams folder will cause it to use up too ram and crash i think
